=> CPQ(quote calculator plugin) - some scanerios can not be achived with the price rule, so with the help of QCP we can add extra functionality on top of price calculation.
# Two type
1. Legegy calculator(old) : with apex class
2. Advance calculator(new) : Javascrip

# Custom Script(Object) use to create script

# every method in QCP has two model  1. quoteModel and 2. quoteLineModel with (.) operator we can access there fields
And if we want to update any of the SF/CPQ field form script we use the 3rd param conn which use jsforce in backend to perform operation

# JS promiss is the best way to write script

# there are 5 events in which script can be executed:
	1. onInit
	2. onBeforeCalculate
	3. onBeforePriceRule
	4. onAfterPriceRule
	5. onAfterCalculate

# every script must 
	return promise.resolve();
	
# lineItem record have a Parent!=null for all bundle option products

Note: Not all fields are available from QCP script. So in custom script record there are filed to difine any of the field(custom) we want to access from Quote, QuoteLine

# CPQ pacakge-> configure-> plugin tab -> Quote Calculator plugin(enter script)
Note: only one script can be used at a time
