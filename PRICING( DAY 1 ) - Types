						----------------------

NOTE:  
- if your quote is using a price book that’s missing a price book entry for a product, that product won’t appear in the product selection page, and can’t be added to the quote.
- Remember to also create a price book entry when you create a new product so that the product can be added to quotes. even with the $0 price

# Right price to right customer at right time.

# Salesforce CPQ can adjust or replace the prices it gets from price books

# If have a lot of different types of customers, and each type requires different pricing. You could create a price book for each customer type, but that means maintaining more data, which means more work for
This allows you to use fewer price books and still see specific pricing for specific customers and situations. 

# Let us implemetn pricing adjustments
EXAMPLE:
	a product that’s sold as part of a bundle can have a different price than one sold on its own. Same product, same price book, two different prices based on the situation.

(#) FIVE TYPE OF TOOLS
-----------------------

1. BLOCK PRICE:	fixed price for a range of quantity.
				EX: video concurrent viewer $X for 1-3 user and $Y for 4-7 user

2. PoT(Percentage of total) :  based on sum/percentage of total price of other products 
				EX: delivery charges
					Tip for the pizza delivery is 15% of overall amount of order.

3. OPTION pricing Override(OPO)	:	replace price of prodict when it is included within the bundle
				EX:
					The price of a burger is $25 when bought in a combo meal, but $30 when bought alone.

4. Cost Plus Markup(C+M) price: allow salesRep to add value on top of product cost.
				EX:
					A car costs the dealer $30,000, and it’s marked up to $34,000 to make commission.

5. Contracted Pricing: Sets account-specific prices 
				EX: 
					Your customer Edge Communications pays $200 for a printer while everyone else pays $275.
					Prime customer pays $10 for cross country shipping but non-prime pays $20.




# NOTE: Multiple pricing + discount tool can be applicable on same quote.
therefore, To keep track of everything that happens, CPQ uses multiple pricing fields on the quote line, each field representing specific pricing adjustments.
	PRICING FIELD and WHAT THEY REPRESENT : also called 'PRICE WATERFAL' because: price from top to bottom effects the next price down.
