DYNAMIC QUOTE: For example, you can hide specific columns in the line items table under certain conditions. Specific pages, sections, and even individual quote terms can appear dynamically as well.

Bundle 
-------
Configurable Bundle : Salesforce admin can group products in a set and enforce rules to ensure the set is complete and accurate as per the business logic. These sets are called bundles.


# CPQ center=BUNDLE( A bundle is simply a group of products we know should be sold together )
	- Bundle have a lead product(thar always will be there)
	 and rest products are added to option
	 
# Salesforce CPQ makes selling complicated product offerings easy by giving sales reps premade product bundles to choose from, and even tweak as needed. With bundles, your sales reps can create accurate quotes in record time.
# CPQ halp sales rep to make sense of wide variety of products 
# in product option - A blank quantity field causes CPQ to leave quantity editable, so the Quantity Editable field is ignored (NOT not the 'min Quantity')


3 TYPE OF BUNDLE:
-----------------
1. Static Bundle : everything is fix(ex: McDonald double chicken gril burger)
2. Configurable Bundle: can be configured with some limitation to prevent impossible configuration(EX: Aalu ka paratha)
3. Nested Bundel: Bundle inside another bundle(KFC Meal)


product option type
------------------


1. Component :
   ----------  this make option part of component i.e id we have added 2 qunatiy in configration page for option. And we have added 3 bundles i.e the total count of this type of option is 2*3 =6
   OR
   It link a option record to individual bundle i.e if multiple quantity of bundle added then the total option product will be (quantity of bundle * quantity of option)

2. Assessory	: 	
   ---------		
   This make the option quantity fixed even though multiple product bundle are added. if we have set quantity to 5 then it will count as overall count of that option regardless of how may product bundle added once.
   OR
   it is shard amoung all same bundle. i.e its quantity will be fixed irrespective of how may bundle quantity we add.
   ex: training- hours for saleforce even if we take how many licences

Editor Only: Hides the item from the output document, shows it in the Quote Line Editor.

- PRODUCT 2field 'Configuration Type and Configuration Event" - control when and how a user can configure the bundle.
	Configurable type = Allowed OR Disabled
	Configuration evetn = Always OR Add OR Edit OR N/ACCOUNT
	
# Typically, when a rep uses groups to organize their quote lines, they want all products within a bundle to appear in a single group. Furthermore, they want the entire bundle to stay together when moved into a different group. The Keep Bundles Together package level setting is enabled by default,

3 IF ADDED MULTPLE BUNDEL- To make bundles easier to distinguish in the Quote Line Editor, i,e TO to see which product goes with which bundle, We have to check 'VISUALIZE PRODUCT HIERARCHY'
