// PRODUCT OPTION CONSIDERATIONS
---------------------------------
1. IF 'Quantity' = 1
	i.e if selected 1 item will be there and no edit allowed with quantity
	So, have to use checkbox (Allow Edit) to let sales rep edit quantity while configuring

2. IF 'min Quantity' = 1
    then 1 quantity will be there if selected and quantity will be editable

- CONFIGURATION in CPQ - meaning when Sales Rep configure quote for the customer
		
== XX == XX == XX == == XX == XX == XX == == XX == XX == XX == == XX == XX == XX == == XX == XX == XX == == XX == XX == XX == == XX == XX == XX == XX == XX == XX == 



									@@@ PRODUCT RULE @@@
									--------------------

- Complex product bundles often need to be configured in specific ways, otherwise they just don’t work.

(#) PRODUCT RULE: 	impose business logic while configuration.
	------------	4 TYPES
					
					1. Alert rule  -  fire warning/alert messages when there’s a possible issue with the configuration.
									ex:
									    Alert, to brought Rep attention if quantity is selected only one.
					2. Selection rule
					3. Validation rule
					4. Filter rule
					
				
	
	- We specify Name, type, scope(specific product or entire quote), Evaluation event(save, load, edit, always), Active/InActive, condition logic(AND, OR, Custom), Message with the 'PRODUCT RULE'
		
	NOW condition on which it fires given in RELATED LIST  - 'ERROR CONDITION' 
								1. record 1
								2. record 2
							Note: error conditonS for 'Product rules' take logic selected in 'PRODUCT RULE' (All, Any, Custom)
															
	- product rule property : 
					Type(alert, selection, validation, filter), Scope(on entire quote or at configuration time only)
					Evaluation event(when to fire-create, edit,save etc..), Condition(ALL=AND and Any=OR), Activate
							
	- NOW
		 to link PRODUCT RULES TO PRODUCTS(many to may) junction object- 'CONFIGURATION RULE'
		 form 'PRODUCT RULE'-->'RELATED LIST'--> Create configuration rule and Active
