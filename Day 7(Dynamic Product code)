GENERATE PRODUCT CODE/DESCTIPTION DYNAMICALLY(form option selection): also called 'Package product codes'
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Advantage: 	Sometimes bundles have special product codes that represent how theyâ€™ve been configured. For example, you can give a special code, LAP-P28-R16-H512, to a laptop with a 2.8GHz processor, 16GB RAM, and 512GB hard drive, so that other teams in your business, like order fulfillment, can get configuration information at a glance.


## STEPS ##

1. on OPTION  'Advance setting' section. we can decide set the dynamic code option will generate if selected and it's positin(index) in lead product bundle(package).

Component Code  // CODE OPTION WILL GENERATE WHEN SELECTED
Component Code Position // index where this code will be displayed in LEAD PRODUCT 'Configured Code Pattern' field

2. on the LEAD product set the 'configuration code pattern' ex: LAP{1}{2}{3}

3. we can check the dynamic code generatied on 'Package Product code' on Lead Product.
