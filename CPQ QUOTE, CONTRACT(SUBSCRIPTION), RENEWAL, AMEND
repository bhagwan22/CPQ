____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

//CREATE QUOTE
---------------
1. Contact --> Opportunity --->Quote  ===> Edit Line ---> add PRODUCTS(suppose we add 5 product, out of them 3 are "SUBSCRIPTION PRODUCTS" i.e it will create 3 SUBSCRIPTION RECORDSto It's generated CONTRACT. when we check Opportunity Contracted[checkbox] later)
2. Check Quote Primary 


//CONTRACT BASED SUBSCRIPTION PROCESS
-----------------------------------
Opportunity "Contracted" checkbox - created a CONTRACT  (have detail about which opp and Quote have created this contract) 
									--->and in Related LIST have "Subscriptions" for 'subscription products' [FOR OUR CASE IT WILL CREATE 3]
									
									Pre requesit
									============
									1. Account should have the right contract settings
									2. Products should be subscription products
									3. Quote must have Start Date and Terms
									



//RENEWAL PROCESS
------------------
Now IF we check contract "Renewal Forcast" = TRUE ==> A RENEWAL OPPORTUNITY Created - only for forecast purpose (THE past opportunity will have lookup filled of Renewal Opportunity)
															- Renewal will only have products that reflect renewable subscription items form original opportunity
															- Renewal(checkbox) is checked for renewal Opportunity
															- Closed date = Past Contract End date
															- Have a lookup to CONTRACT(Renewed Contract) - the contract that had originated this renewal(Past Contract)
															- and Subsequently chain follow(if CONTRACTED(checkbox) true) step 1
															
															

//AMANDMENT PROCESS
--------------------
	# IF CUSTOMER WANT TO MAKE A CHANGE AFTER FEW MONTH GONE BY  - Like increasing the quantity BUT ALL SHOULD BE END ON THA SAME TERM(end date) ---> we user Amend button on Contract
	
	Amend(BUTTON) on contract 
	ON CLICK event
	--------------
					Behind the scene we have created a
					1. Amandment opportunity
					2. Amandment Quote + marked primary for the above Amandment Opportunity
					3. Takes us to directly Quote Line Editor
						IMPORTANT:
						----------
							A) Quote Line editor shows us the Products(quantity, UnitPrice) but Net price = $0 because(It shows us the products customer already paid for/purchased)
							Now that if we make changes(+ve or -ve[i.e return]) cahnges to Quantity The Net new price for the new configured products will be reflected in Net Total
							
		
					4. NOW if we Save the QuoteLineEditor. we redirected to 'Amandment Quote' (that have lookup to Amandment Opportunity)
					5. the ' Amandment Opportunity' will have a reference to CONTRACT THAT IS AMANDED(original contract)
					
					6. NOW if the AMANBED OPPORTUNITY  "Contracted(checkbox)" checked ==> It update the "Subscription related List" of Original Contract



NOTE: Sometime cuatomer can ask to Amand and till then we have created Renewal, i.e Renewal will only have "Subscription products" that parent opportunoty have at time of renewal(checkbox)=True, So to Sync all the Amanded subscription products(of original opportunity) [ONCE ALL AMANDMENT DONE + AMANBED OPPORTUNITY  "Contracted(checkbox)" =checked] we must check "Renewal Quote" check box form Original Contact(contract get ammanded subscription products) ==> It will sync Amanded products to Reneal product.
