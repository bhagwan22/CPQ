'twin fields' - identical field(have matching field types, and have matching API names)
				used for when we have to pass custom field values from the first object to the second object
				note:
				1. To map one field to another, you need Read access on the source field and Edit access on the target field.
				2. Standard fields can’t be mapped between objects.
				
	
				
MAPPING
--------

# PRIMARY QUOTE field to opportunity page layouts(automatically looks up to the primary quote for the opportunity). 
                                                          If the primary quote changes, Salesforce CPQ updates this field accordingly.

# Salesforce CPQ maps from 'opportunity products' to quote lines only for standalone products and only when opportunity products have been created before a sales rep creates the opportunity’s first primary quote.

# Order 'Payment Term'(picklist) map from Quote 'Payment terems'(picklist) so if any new value added to Quote 'Payment Term' the similar value should be added to global picklist 'Payment Term'

# Order Product = Quote Line

# Invoice Line = Order Product

# Opportunity Product = Quote Line

# Subscription = Quote Line
# Quote Line = Subscriptions

# Contract Line Item = Quote Line
# Quote Line = Contract Line Item

# Asset = Quote Line
# Quote Line = Asset(Salesforce CPQ maps from the asset back to the quote line only during amendment and renewal processes when quote lines are generated from assets.)


NOTE: If we make a bundle a Favorite and then add that favorite to the quote line editor, it won’t capture any twin field values.
